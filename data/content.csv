To accomplish this, students are expected to complete a series of challenges that assess their progress throughout the course.  Lectures provide the necessary background information that enables students to seek out solutions for challenges.  The first set of challenges ensures that students cover a core set of competencies.  The latter half of class is designed to facilitate the exploration of new technologies, and apply them to projects of interest.  "participation,"Class time is designed to be a fun and interactive time for students to engage with both the material and one another.  We will follow a mixed lecture/exercise format that allows students to experiment with techniques as they are introduced in a lecture.  It is an expectation that students are actively engaged in these activities, and assist their classmates when appropriate. "
